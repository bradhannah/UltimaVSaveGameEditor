# Ultima V Save Game Editor and Summarizer

## Introduction
The intent of this tool is simplify editing and getting information from Ultima V save games.

## Backstory
I have been developing Ultima V Redux for quite some time. One of things that takes me the longest is recreating scenarios in the OG Ultima V to confirm I have emulated the same behaviour. This usually requires editting by hand in a hex editor.

The intention of this tool is to make that all move MUCH faster. As a plus - it should be cool and interesting for people who want to monkey around.
